# The-Utilization-of-Computer-Vision-Based-Line-Follower-Algorithm-for-Industrial-Forklift

project introduces an advanced industrial forklift automation system by integrating a computer vision-based line follower algorithm. This cutting-edge technology is designed to enhance efficiency and productivity in industrial settings. The project employs an Omron Relay MY2-GS to seamlessly switch between manual and automatic modes, providing users with flexibility and control.

In manual mode, operators can effortlessly maneuver the forklift using a joystick, allowing for precise navigation and placement of materials. This feature ensures ease of use and familiarity for operators while maintaining a high level of control.

The real innovation lies in the automatic mode, where the forklift harnesses the power of a connected camera and mini PC Jetson Nano. The computer vision-based line follower algorithm, rooted in color detection based on the HSV format, enables the forklift to autonomously follow predefined paths on the floor. This capability streamlines material handling processes, reducing the need for constant operator intervention.

Moreover, the algorithm extends its functionality to detect and recognize QR codes. This additional layer of intelligence enables the forklift to interpret QR code commands, facilitating a range of activities such as material pickup, delivery, or specific maneuvers. The seamless integration of QR code recognition adds a dynamic element to the automation, allowing for adaptable and customizable operations based on the specific requirements of each task.
